# houdini-codes
Like a barn, except it houses houdini tools, python scripts and other nonsense. 

### [python/scaffolding.py](https://github.com/se-beast-ian/houdini-codes/blob/main/python/scaffolding.py)
Windows > Python Source Editor. Paste the python script and hit apply. 
The python script will create scaffolders (geo nodes) for each object in the list *scaffolding_items*.
